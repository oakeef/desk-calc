# desk-calc
Simple desk price calculator in Python  

Working with variables and If Statements. This was one of my very first assignments in Python. It is very simple and looking back on it there are a few things I would like to change. I would like to add validation on the inputs and continue looping the program until the user does not want to get any more quotes. Also maybe display the desk quote at the end.
